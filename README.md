# ND Police Lockers
**This is not ready for use with ND Core**

They say *"you can't teach an old dog new tricks."*

Well, I am trying anyway. I am a 56 year old coding beginner. I decided about a year ago to teach myself basic programming. I started studying Lua and the basics of scripting for FiveM. I have a pretty good understanding of how things work, I have watched a bunch of tutorials and read a couple of books. I have been helping on a few support forums and Discord servers. 

I decided on my journey of learning, I would find interesting and useful open source resources and convert and refactor them to work on my development server. I use `ND Core` and `ox_inventory` with much of the Overextended tools as well.

Hopefully, I can get this to work and offer it to the **ND** community.
